# randomizer

This is a script to generate a random response of some requests.<br>


## Problem
Do you know this: sometimes I don't know what to do next. <br>
So i scripted a small randomizer, which is telling me what to do next ;)<br>

## Solution

Just type in your "requests" (at the end of each line press enter).<br>
If you are done, let one line empty and press again enter.<br>
